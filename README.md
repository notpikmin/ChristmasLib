# Christmas Lib
Christmas Lib is a library I wrote in my spare time to reduce duplicate code in various mods. It has evolved passed a simple bit of boilerplate code to, in my opinion, a fully fledged modding library for vrchat. Alot of code could of been written in a more effiecent way, but this was a learning experience for me.

Includes a button api I wrote, loosely inspired by https://github.com/DubyaDude/RubyButtonAPI.
